# Marble Nvim

Marble is a custom Neo Vim configuration made for me to understand better how my editor works and have it tweaked to the very core.

It is mostly oriented to my C++ workflow, so there is no much going on apart from that.

I have also designed the marble colorscheme this editor uses (I was also curious about creating my own colorscheme)

# Installation

Marble Nvim includes a custom installation script that you can use for easy cloning and installation.

Contact me if there is any errors with the intended use of this script.

```sh
bash <(curl -S https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheMidnightShow/starry.nvim/master/install.sh)
```
